# Morphologic Abnormality Modeling

The morphologic abnormality subhierarchy is located two levels below the Body structure hierarchy with siblings  _Apoptosis_ and _Structure resulting from tissue repair process_ :

  * SNOMED CT concept
    * Body structure (body structure)
      * Body structure, altered from its original anatomical structure (morphologic abnormality)  

        * Apoptosis (morphologic abnormality)
        * Morphologically abnormal structure (morphologic abnormality)
        * Structure resulting from tissue repair process (morphologic abnormality)

The concepts in the morphologic abnormality hierarchy represent abnormal body structures. 

The subhierarchy of 118956008 |Body structure, altered from its original anatomical structure (morphologic abnormality)| is to remain primitive. Authors are not to define morphologic abnormality concepts.
