# Clinical Finding and Disorder

Definition| Examples  
---|---  
  
  * Clinical finding: normal/abnormal observations, judgments, or assessments of patients

  

  * Disorder: always and necessarily an abnormal clinical state

Clinical findings or observations are the active acquisition of subjective or objective information from a primary source. This includes information acquired from human observers, through recording of data via the use of scientific instruments, or indirectly from samples taken from the source, and evaluated separately.

The term _observations_ should not be confused with _Observable entity._ Observable entity is the name of something that can be observed and represents a question or assessment (e.g. |systolic blood pressure|, |color of iris|, |gender|) which can produce an answer or result.

The default context for a _Clinical finding_ concept is:

  * Present (vs. being absent)
  * Subject of the record (the patient)
  * Current, if not specifically stated or specified to a time in the past by an entity linked to the concept

The _Clinical finding_ hierarchy contains the subhierarchy of _Disorder_. Concepts that are descendants of _Disease (disorder)_ are always and necessarily abnormal clinical states. The Disease subtype allows diseases to be subtypes of other disorders, as well as subtypes of findings.

Concepts with a semantic tag of  _disorder_ , must have a parent of Disease (disorder) or subtype of Disease (disorder).
